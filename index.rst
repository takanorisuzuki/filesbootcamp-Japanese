Nutanix Files  ブートキャンプへようこそ!

This workbook accompanies an instructor-led session that introduces Nutanix Era and many common management tasks. Each section has a lesson and an exercise to give you hands-on practice. The instructor explains the exercises and answers any additional questions that you may have.

Traditionally, file storage has been yet another silo within IT, introducing unnecessary complexity and suffering from the same issues of scale and lack of continuous innovation seen in SAN storage. Nutanix believes there is no room for silos in the Enterprise Cloud. By approaching file storage as an app, running in software on top of a proven HCI core, Nutanix Files  delivers high performance, scalability, and rapid innovation through One Click management.

**In this lab you will step through managaging SMB shares and NFS exports, scale out the environment, and explore upcoming Files features. The lab will provide key considerations around deployment, configuration, and use cases.**

Environment Details
+++++++++++++++++++

Nutanix Workshops are intended to be run in the Nutanix Hosted POC environment. Your cluster will be provisioned with all necessary images, networks, and VMs required to complete the exercises.

Networking
..........

Hosted POC clusters follow a standard naming convention:

- **Cluster Name** - POC\ *XYZ*
- **Subnet** - 10.**42**.\ *XYZ*\ .0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.**42**.\ *XYZ*\ .37

For example:

- **Cluster Name** - POC055
- **Subnet** - 10.42.55.0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.42.55.37

Throughout the Workshop there are multiple instances where you will need to substitute *XYZ* with the correct octet for your subnet, for example:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - IP Address
     - Description
   * - 10.42.\ *XYZ*\ .37
     - Nutanix Cluster Virtual IP
   * - 10.42.\ *XYZ*\ .39
     - **PC** VM IP, Prism Central
   * - 10.42.\ *XYZ*\ .40
     - **DC** VM IP, NTNXLAB.local Domain Controller

Each cluster is configured with 2 VLANs which can be used for VMs:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 25 25 10 40
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Network Name
    - Address
    - VLAN
    - DHCP Scope
  * - Primary
    - 10.42.\ *XYZ*\ .1/25
    - 0
    - 10.42.\ *XYZ*\ .50-10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .124
  * - Secondary
    - 10.42.\ *XYZ*\ .129/25
    - *XYZ1*
    - 10.42.\ *XYZ*\ .132-10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .253

Credentials
...........

.. note::

  The *<Cluster Password>* is unique to each cluster and will be provided by the leader of the Workshop.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 35 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Credential
     - Username
     - Password
   * - Prism Element
     - admin
     - *<Cluster Password>*
   * - Prism Central
     - admin

   * - Controller VM
     - nutanix
     - *<Cluster Password>*
   * - Prism Central VM

Each cluster has a dedicated domain controller VM, **DC**, responsible for providing AD services for the **NTNXLAB.local** domain. The domain is populated with the following Users and Groups:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 35 40
   :header-rows: 1
